    <h1>Dr.A P J Abdul Kalam</h1>
    <h4>[Former Indian President]</h4>
    <h3>Born</h3> <p>15 October 1931,Rameswaram.</p>
    <h3>Died</h3> <p>25 July 2015,.</p>
    <h3>Full Name</h3> <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam.</p>
    <p> Abdul kalam was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the <mark >11th President 
        of India from 2002 to 2007</mark>.Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras 
        Institute of Technology and in 1958 joined the Defence Research and Development
         Organisation (DRDO). In 1969 he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation, 
         where he was project director of the SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle that 
         was both designed and produced in India. Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program 
         that produced a number of successful missiles, which helped earn him the 
         nickname <mark>“Missile Man.”</mark> Among those successes was Agni, 
         India’s first intermediate-range ballistic missile, which incorporated aspects of 
         the SLV-III and was launched in 1989.</p>
         <p>From 1992 to 1997 Kalam was scientific adviser to the defense minister, and he later
             served as principal scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the government with the rank 
             of cabinet minister. His prominent role in the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests 
             solidified India as a nuclear power and established Kalam as a national hero, although the
              tests caused great concern in the international community. In 1998 Kalam put forward a 
              countrywide plan called Technology Vision 2020, which he described as a road map for 
              transforming India from a less-developed to a developed society in 20 years. The plan 
              called for, among other measures, increasing agricultural productivity, emphasizing 
              technology as a vehicle for economic growth, and widening access to health care and 
              education.</p>
              <p>In 2002 India’s ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) put forward Kalam to succeed
                 outgoing President Kocheril Raman Narayanan. Kalam was nominated by the Hindu 
                 nationalist (Hindutva) NDA even though he was Muslim, and his stature and popular appeal
                  were such that even the main opposition party, the Indian National Congress,
                  also proposed his candidacy. Kalam easily won the election and was sworn in as 
                  India’s 11th president, a largely ceremonial post, in July 2002. He left office at 
                  the end of his term in 2007 and was succeeded by Pratibha Patil, the country’s 
                  first woman president.Upon returning to civilian life, Kalam remained committed 
                  to using science and technology to transform India into a developed country and 
                  served as a lecturer at several universities. On July 27, 2015, he collapsed
                   while delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong and was 
                   pronounced dead from cardiac arrest soon afterward.Kalam wrote several
                    books, including an autobiography, Wings of Fire (1999). Among his numerous
                     awards were two of the country’s highest honours, <mark>the Padma Vibhushan (1990)
                        and the Bharat Ratna (1997).</mark> </p>
